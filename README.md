An Inventory Management System in C is a console application that allows users to manage and maintain a database of different products in a store's inventory. The system is designed to handle basic operations like adding new items, updating existing items, viewing items, and deleting items from the inventory.

Here's a brief overview of the functionalities:

Add New Item: This feature allows the user to add a new item to the inventory. The user will be prompted to enter details such as item ID, name, price, and quantity.

Update Existing Item: This feature allows the user to update the details of an existing item in the inventory. The user can modify details like the name, price, and quantity of the item.

View Items: This feature allows the user to view all the items present in the inventory. It displays details like item ID, name, price, and quantity of each item.

Delete Item: This feature allows the user to delete an item from the inventory. The user needs to provide the item ID of the item to be deleted.

The system uses file handling and data structure to store and retrieve the inventory data. It uses a struct data type to store the details of each item and a file to store the inventory data persistently.

Please note that this is a simple console-based system and does not include advanced features like search, sort, or GUI. It's a good starting point for beginners to understand the basics of file handling and data structure in C.
